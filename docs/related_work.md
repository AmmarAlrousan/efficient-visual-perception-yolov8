## Related Work

This project is inspired by the pruning methodology presented in:

Zhang et al., "Optimization of YOLOv8 Model Based on Pruning", 2024.

The original work explores channel pruning strategies to reduce computational
complexity while maintaining detection performance.

In this project, the general pruning concept is adapted and applied to dense
retail shelf detection scenarios, focusing on deployment-oriented efficiency
trade-offs.
